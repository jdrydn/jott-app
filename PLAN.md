# jott-app — Plan

> "Jot it down" — standalone, offline-first, timestamped journal application.
> Single-binary CLI that bundles a local web UI. Electron later, maybe.

Source of truth for what we're building, why, and in what order. Open questions live at the bottom until resolved, then move into the relevant section. A running decisions log lives at the end.

---

## 1. Vision

A frictionless personal journal where every **entry** is timestamped at creation. One binary, `jottapp`. Run it; it starts a local web server and opens your browser to a focused editor. Shells out to `claude` for summarisation/reflection.

(The verb stays "jot it down" — the brand. The data primitive is `Entry`.)

**Shape v1:** single Bun-compiled binary, ships its own web server + bundled UI. Web UI is the only interface.
**Shape v2 (later, optional):** wrap the same web UI in Electron for native install / system tray / auto-update.
**Shape v3 (later, optional):** add CLI subcommands (`jottapp new`, `jottapp list`, etc.) for terminal-native capture and scripting.

**Anti-goals:**
- Not Notion / Obsidian (no nested pages, wikilinks, databases)
- Not a task manager (no todos, reminders, scheduling)
- Not collaborative (single-user, single-device)
- Not a SaaS (no cloud-hosted version — the binary _is_ the product)
- Not a CLI tool in v1 (CLI subcommands are an explicit future milestone, not the focus)

---

## 2. Core principles

1. **Offline-first, always.** Fully usable with zero network. The `claude` integration is the only optional online feature.
2. **Zero friction to write.** `jottapp` → server starts → browser opens → focused editor.
3. **Append-only-feeling.** Entries are timestamped at creation. Edits allowed; timestamp is the entry's identity.
4. **Durable & portable.** SQLite file you can copy. Plain markdown export. No lock-in.
5. **Small, boring, fast.** Minimal stack. Single binary. Ship.
6. **OSS, releasable.** Tests, docs, CI from day one.

---

## 3. Shape

### Binary: `jottapp`

One command. Flags, no subcommands.

```sh
jottapp                       # start server, open browser
jottapp --port 4853           # override port (default: 4853)
jottapp --no-open             # don't auto-open browser
jottapp --db /path/to.db      # override DB location
jottapp --version
jottapp --help
```

### Local web server

- **Framework:** Hono, running on Bun.
- **API layer:** tRPC mounted at `/api/trpc` (via Hono adapter), end-to-end typesafe between server router and React client.
- Binds to `127.0.0.1` only (never `0.0.0.0`).
- **No auth** — pure trust-the-loopback. Personal-use single-device app.
- Fixed default port `4853`. If taken, **fail to start** with a clear message ("port 4853 in use — is `jottapp` already running?"). No fallback.
- **In production:** Hono serves the pre-built React app as static assets, embedded into the compiled binary via `bun build --compile`.
- **In development:** two processes — Vite serves the frontend on `127.0.0.1:4853` (user-facing URL, matches prod), Hono runs on `127.0.0.1:4854`, Vite proxies `/api/*` to Hono. Single user-facing URL, HMR works, origins effectively share via the proxy. Orchestrated by `scripts/dev.ts` (one `bun run dev` command).
  - Why not Hono-mounts-Vite via middleware? Vite's dev-server SSR loader runs the Hono entry through Node's ESM loader, which can't resolve `bun:` scheme imports (`bun:sqlite`). The inverse direction (`@hono/vite-dev-server`) has the same problem.
- Lifecycle: foreground process. `Ctrl+C` to stop. No daemon mode.
- Single-instance is implicitly handled by the port lock — a second `jottapp` will fail to bind.

### Distribution

- Single executable per OS: macOS arm64/x64, Linux x64/arm64, Windows x64.
- GitHub Releases.
- Homebrew tap (`brew install jdrydn/jott/jottapp`) — eventually.
- `npm i -g jottapp` as a fallback channel.

## 4. Data model

Primary entity: **Entry** (a journal entry). **Tag** is a normalized, reusable label with a type (`topic` for `#hashtags`, `user` for `@mentions`) and visual properties (initials, colour). Entries link to tags via a join table.

Schemas are sync-ready (ULIDs, soft deletes, `updatedAt`) even though sync is out of scope — keeps the door open.

```ts
type Entry = {
  id: string;          // ULID
  createdAt: number;   // epoch ms, immutable, the entry's identity
  updatedAt: number;   // epoch ms, bumped on edit
  body: string;        // markdown source (no headings; bold/italic/lists/code/links/blockquote/etc)
  deletedAt?: number;  // soft delete
};

type Tag = {
  id: string;          // ULID
  type: 'topic' | 'user';  // topic = #hashtag, user = @mention
  initials: string;    // short label for chips/avatars, e.g. "JD", "WK"
  name: string;        // display name, e.g. "James Doe", "Work"
  color: string;       // hex, e.g. "#3B82F6"
  createdAt: number;
  updatedAt: number;
};

type EntryTag = {           // many-to-many join
  entryId: string;
  tagId: string;
  nameWhenLinked: string;   // literal token from body at link-time (e.g. "old-name").
                            // Never mutated on Tag rename — lets the renderer match
                            // body tokens to the right row and substitute current Tag.name.
  createdAt: number;        // when this tag was first applied to this entry
};

type Profile = {
  id: 'me';            // singleton row
  name: string;        // "James" — for "Hello James"
  theme?: 'light' | 'dark' | 'system';
  createdAt: number;
};

type Setting = {
  key: string;         // "claude.binary", "db.path", "server.port", "editor", ...
  value: string;
};
```

### Tag extraction & lifecycle

- Editor scans body for `#word` (Topic) and `@word` (User) tokens at write-time.
- On save, the backend:
  1. Tokenises the body for tag references.
  2. Upserts `tags` rows by `(type, name)` — first sighting creates the tag with a default colour + initials derived from name.
  3. Reconciles `entry_tags` for that entry (insert new links with `nameWhenLinked = token`, remove links no longer present in body).
- **Body is the source of truth.** `tags` + `entry_tags` are derived/cached state. Any edit resyncs.
- Tag colour/initials editable later from a Tags settings screen (defer to M3+).

### Tag delete (cascade)

- Deleting a Tag cascade-deletes its `entry_tags` rows.
- Entry bodies still contain the literal `#word` / `@word` text. The frontend must render these gracefully as **"broken" tags** — plain text or muted styling, never crash, never a dead chip.
- A subsequent edit to the body that retains the token re-creates the Tag (auto-extraction) and re-establishes the link.

### Tag rename (display swap)

- Renaming a Tag updates `tags.name` only. Body text and `entry_tags.nameWhenLinked` are untouched.
- On render, the frontend:
  1. Finds each `#word` / `@word` token in the body.
  2. Looks up the matching `entry_tags` row by `nameWhenLinked = word`.
  3. Renders the chip using the Tag's _current_ `name`, `initials`, `color`.
- Result: rename a Tag once, every historical entry shows the new name without rewriting bodies.
- Markdown export emits literal body text (not current Tag.name) — body is canonical.

### Initials defaults

When a Tag is auto-created, initials are derived from name:
- Multi-word: first letter of each word, capped at 2 words → `"James Doe"` → `JD`, `"work project alpha"` → `WP`.
- Single-word: first two letters → `"work"` → `WO`, `"james"` → `JA`.
- Always editable later in the Tags settings screen.

### Visual treatment

- `#topic` and `@user` tokens render inline as styled chips using the tag's colour.
- Topic tags use a `#` sigil + colour-tinted background; User tags use the `initials` (avatar-style) + `@name`.
- The TipTap extension reads the same regex as the backend extractor, so the editor and storage stay in lockstep.

### IDs

Hidden in the web UI entirely — implementation detail for the data layer.

---

## 5. Storage

- **Engine:** SQLite.
- **Driver:** `bun:sqlite` (Bun built-in).
- **ORM / query builder:** Drizzle (`drizzle-orm/bun-sqlite`). Schemas defined in TS, queries fully typed.
- **DB location:** `$XDG_DATA_HOME/jottapp/jottapp.db` (Linux/macOS) or `%APPDATA%\jottapp\jottapp.db` (Windows). Overridable via `JOTTAPP_DB` env or `--db` flag.
- **Schema:** `entries`, `entry_fts` (FTS5 virtual table over `entries.body`), `tags`, `entry_tags` (join), `profile`, `settings`.
- **Migrations:** `PRAGMA user_version` pattern with one `.sql` file per version. Migrations live in `backend/db/migrations/0001_init.sql`, `0002_*.sql`, etc. A `migrations/index.ts` statically imports each as a raw string (Vite/Bun support `?raw`) and exports them in order — so `bun build --compile` embeds them automatically, no runtime folder reads. Runner (~15 LOC): read `PRAGMA user_version`, apply newer migrations in order, bump `user_version` after each. Drizzle owns query building; we own migration application.

Future Electron migration: Drizzle schema is portable; swap `drizzle-orm/bun-sqlite` for `drizzle-orm/better-sqlite3`. Same SQL, same types.

Encryption is deferred — relying on OS disk encryption (FileVault / BitLocker / LUKS) for v1.

---

## 6. UI (web app, bundled in binary)

- **Framework:** React 19 + TypeScript + Vite (dev), bundled into the binary for prod.
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS.
- **Editor:** TipTap (ProseMirror), restricted to allowed marks/blocks:
  - bold, italic, strikethrough
  - inline code, code blocks
  - ordered + unordered lists, task lists
  - links
  - blockquotes
  - horizontal rules
  - **no headings**, **no tables** (revisit later)
- **Tag highlighting:** TipTap extension that detects `#word` (Topic) and `@word` (User) tokens and styles them with each tag's colour/initials. Uses the same regex as the backend extractor so editor + storage stay in lockstep.
- **Markdown:** TipTap (de)serialises to markdown for storage. Round-trip tested.
- **Routing:** TBD — likely a small client-side router for `/`, `/entries/:id`, `/search`, `/settings`. Defer until M2.
- **Layout:** mobile-first responsive — desktop is primary, phone/tablet works through the browser.
- **No auth on the local server** for v1, bind to 127.0.0.1.

---

## 7. AI integration (Claude shell-out)

- The server shells out to the `claude` binary (Claude Code) when the UI calls an AI tRPC procedure.
- **Startup check:** on boot, the server probes for `claude` on `PATH` via `Bun.which('claude')` and runs `claude --version` to capture the version string. The result is threaded through the tRPC context (`ctx.claude.{available, binaryPath, version}`). If `claude` isn't found, AI procedures throw `PRECONDITION_FAILED`; the UI greys out controls and links to settings.
- **Driver pattern:** the active driver is selected via the `ai.driver` setting, defaulting to `claude`. Driver-specific config sits under `ai.<driver>.*`. Only `claude` is implemented; an unknown driver value cleanly disables AI with a reason.
- **tRPC procedures — `ai.*` router:**
  - `ai.status`     — query: returns `{ driver, enabled, reason?, model, binaryPath, version }`
  - `ai.summarise(input: { from?, to?, tagId? })` — mutation: date-window TL;DR
  - `ai.reflect(input: { from?, to?, tagId? })` — mutation: themes/patterns
  - `ai.ask(input: { q, from?, to?, tagId? })`     — mutation: Q&A over a slice
- All three mutations share a `fetchEntrySlice` helper that filters by `from`/`to`/`tagId`, drops soft-deleted rows, takes the **most-recent 100** entries (hard-coded `ENTRY_CAP`), then sorts oldest-first for the prompt.
- **Settings registry (`SETTING_DEFAULTS`):** an object of `key → default`, so new keys auto-merge into `getAll`'s response. The UI never sees `undefined` for a known setting.
  - `ai.driver` — defaults to `claude`
  - `ai.claude.config-dir` — defaults to `$HOME/.claude`; passed to the spawned process as `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`
  - `ai.claude.model` — defaults to `sonnet`; passed as `--model`
- **Shell-out:** `claude --print --model <model>` invoked via `Bun.spawn`, prompt piped to stdin, response read from stdout. 180-second timeout via AbortController. stderr tail surfaced on non-zero exit.
- **Privacy:** AI features send journal content to Anthropic via `claude`. Opt-in by virtue of being a separate UI button. Default capture/read flow stays 100% local. UI shows a one-liner near AI controls explaining this.

---

## 8. Personalisation

No auth. A local `profile` row holds name + preferences. First time the UI loads with no profile, it shows an onboarding screen asking for the user's name. After that, the UI header shows "Hello $name".

```
$ jottapp
jottapp v0.1.0 — http://127.0.0.1:4853 (opening browser…)
Press Ctrl+C to stop.
```

## 9. Milestones

Gated — each leaves a working, runnable binary.

### M0 — Hello server (weekend prototype) — ✓ shipped 2026-05-13
- Bun project scaffold, TS strict
- Drizzle + `bun:sqlite` wired up, first migration (`entries` table)
- Hono on `127.0.0.1:4853`, fails if port taken (`:4854` in dev to leave `:4853` for Vite)
- tRPC mounted at `/api/trpc` with `entries.list` + `entries.create` procedures
- Dev: Vite on `:4853` + Hono on `:4854` via `scripts/dev.ts`; Vite proxies `/api/*` to Hono
- Minimal React 19 + Tailwind v4 app: list of entries + plain `<textarea>` to add, talking to tRPC via `@trpc/react-query`
- `jottapp` boots server + auto-opens browser
- `bun build --compile` produces a single binary with UI assets embedded
- CI: GitHub Actions — lint + format-check + typecheck + test, plus 5-target cross-compile matrix (macOS arm64/x64, Linux x64/arm64, Windows x64) with artifact upload
- **Goal:** ✓ proven — single-binary + server + DB + UI + typed-API pipeline end-to-end.

### M1 — Rich editor + tags ✓ shipped 2026-05-14
- TipTap with the allowed mark set (§6)
- Markdown serialize on save, parse on load
- Round-trip tests (golden files)
- Tag extraction (`#topic`, `@user`) on save → `tags` + `entry_tags` reconciliation
- Tag highlighting in editor (chip rendering with colour/initials)

### M2 — Capture polish + Discover ✓ shipped 2026-05-14
- Autosave (debounced) — no save button
- Edit / soft-delete / restore (in UI)
- FTS5 search bar
- Date-range filter, tag filter (by tag chip)
- Day/week grouping in list view

### M3 — Config & profile ✓ shipped 2026-05-15
- Wouter router: `/` redirects to `/start` (no profile) or `/timeline`; `/settings` for config
- `/start` onboarding screen (asks name) — also reachable to edit later
- "Hello $name" header on `/timeline`; banner on `/timeline` when no profile yet
- `/settings` page: name, theme (light/dark/system), db path (read-only), claude binary
- `profile` (singleton) + `settings` (key/value) tables; `system.info` exposes db path + version
- Dark mode visual pass: class-based `dark:` variants applied across all components, with system-pref detection

### M4 — AI integration ✓ shipped 2026-05-15
- Driver pattern: `ai.driver` setting selects backend; only `claude` implemented. Driver-specific config under `ai.<driver>.*`
- Settings registry refactored to a defaults-object (`SETTING_DEFAULTS`); `getAll` always returns effective values
- Startup detection of `claude` on PATH (`Bun.which`) + version probe; threaded through tRPC context
- tRPC `ai.*` router: `status` query, `summarise` / `reflect` / `ask` mutations
- Shared entry-slice helper (`from`/`to`/`tagId`, hard cap 100, oldest-first for prompts)
- Prompt builder per task with profile-name personalisation
- Shell-out via `Bun.spawn` (`claude --print --model <model>` + `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` env), 180s timeout
- Sidebar AI block on `/timeline` with three buttons; modal panel for action picking, current-window summary, question input (ask), result + copy
- Settings page surfaces driver / config dir / model with a live "AI status" banner

### M5 — Durability ✓ shipped 2026-05-16
- Markdown export/import codec (`backend/data/markdown.ts`): single concatenated `.md` file with one HTML-comment marker (`<!-- @entry id="…" created="…" updated="…" -->`) per entry. Survives bodies containing horizontal rules (`---`); round-trip tested.
- `data.exportMarkdown` query (oldest-first, soft-deleted excluded) returns `{ filename, text, count }`; UI triggers a Blob download.
- `data.importMarkdown` mutation: parses, inserts entries whose IDs don't already exist (skip rather than merge), reconciles tags from body. Returns `{ imported, skipped, total }`.
- Backup helper (`backend/data/backup.ts`): `VACUUM INTO` snapshot to `jottapp-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.db`; default dir = `<dbPath dirname>/backups/`, overridable via `backup.dir` setting.
- `backup.onQuit` setting (`"true"`/`"false"`, default off) hooked into SIGINT/SIGTERM in `backend/index.ts` — snapshot taken before close, failures logged but don't block shutdown.
- `data.backup` mutation for manual UI-triggered snapshots; `data.backupDirPreview` query exposes resolved/default path for the Settings hint.
- Raw `Database` threaded through tRPC context (needed for `VACUUM INTO`).
- Settings page gains a "Data" section: export, import (file picker), backup-on-quit toggle, backup-dir input, "Backup now" button.

### M6 — Image attachments ✓ shipped 2026-05-16
- `attachments` table FK'd to entries (`entry_id` nullable for drafts): `id`, `entryId`, `kind: 'image'` (enum, future-proofed), `filename`, `mime`, `bytes`, `width`, `height`, `createdAt`. Files live on disk under `<dbPath dirname>/attachments/<id>.<ext>` — DB stays lean.
- Hono routes `POST /api/attachments` (multipart, 10 MB cap, image-MIME allowlist) + `GET /api/attachments/:id` (id-addressable, immutable cache); tRPC stays for everything else.
- `backend/attachments/reconcile.ts` mirrors the tag reconciler — body scan binds orphan rows to the entry on create/update and unlinks (deleting row + file) anything no longer referenced.
- Startup orphan sweep: rows with `entry_id IS NULL AND created_at < now - 24h` are GC'd (file + row) before the server binds.
- TipTap editor extended with `@tiptap/extension-image` (block-only), a `/`-triggered slash menu (hand-rolled PM plugin), and an `imageUpload` placeholder node (React NodeView dropzone). Paste + drag/drop also upload + insert.
- Markdown image round-trip: `paragraph-with-only-image` promotes to a block-level PM `image` node; inline images split the paragraph.
- Export embeds `/api/attachments/:id` URLs as `data:<mime>;base64,...` URIs (single-file `.md` invariant preserved). Import decodes, writes files, creates rows, and rewrites URLs in the persisted body.
- Settings → System now surfaces the attachments dir (read-only).

### M7 — Timeline pagination ✓ shipped 2026-05-16
- `entries.list` returns `{ items, nextCursor }`; default page size 100 (max 200). Cursor is `{ ts, id }` where `ts` is `createdAt` (or `deletedAt` in trash mode) and `id` is the secondary tiebreaker for entries sharing a millisecond.
- Stable ordering: `(orderColumn DESC, id DESC)`. Fetches `limit + 1` rows to detect more without a separate count query.
- Frontend swapped to `useInfiniteQuery` with `getNextPageParam: last => last.nextCursor ?? undefined`; a "Read more →" button appears at the bottom of the timeline while `hasNextPage`.
- Pagination is for the timeline (`list`) only — `search` remains a single FTS query capped at 50 results.
- `scripts/seed-30d.ts` added for local demo: ~6 entries/day across the last 30 days, randomised between 8am–6pm, drawn from a small template/people/topic pool so tag chips render.

### M8 - Improved tagging
- Tags should be stored in entry text as `{{ tag id=${Tag.id} }}`, but rendered correctly in the UI
- In Markdown exports, tags should be represented as `@Tag.name` (or `#Tag.name`) with `<!-- Tag: ${UUID} -->` as comment right after
  - And at the bottom of the export, we should have a `Tags` section of a table with Tag properties (ID, Type, Name, Initials, Color)
  - Which should be easily imported to rebuild!
- When typing in a tag, a dropdown should start to autocomplete names (ask me for an example screenshot), capped to top 4
- And when I want to create a new tag, let me type in the name including spaces, but I need to use the keyboard to break out of the tag naming journey

### M9 — Formal releases
- Cross-compile binaries (macOS arm64/x64, Linux x64/arm64, Windows x64)
- GitHub Releases via Actions
- `npm i -g jottapp` channel
- README polish, `--help` quality, a simple landing page

### M10 — Releases via Homebreak
- Homebrew tap repository `jottapp/setup/jottapp`
- Updating when new releases to main repo are published

### M11 — Electron wrapper (long-haul stretch)
- Wrap the same web app in Electron for native install + tray + auto-update
- Swap Drizzle driver from `bun-sqlite` → `better-sqlite3` (one import change, schema unchanged)
- Hono runs under Node inside Electron's main process, serves the same renderer

### M-future — sync, mobile, encryption
- Re-evaluate once v1 is in your hands.

## 10. Tooling baseline

- **Lang:** TypeScript (strict)
- **Runtime / builder:** Bun (`bun build --compile`)
- **Server:** Hono
- **API:** tRPC + `@trpc/server`'s fetch adapter (Hono speaks fetch natively)
- **DB:** `bun:sqlite`
- **ORM:** Drizzle (`drizzle-orm/bun-sqlite` + `drizzle-kit` for migrations)
- **UI framework:** React 19, Vite, Tailwind CSS v4
- **UI data fetching:** `@trpc/react-query` (React Query under the hood)
- **Editor:** TipTap
- **Markdown:** TipTap's built-in serializer + `marked` for any one-shot rendering needs
- **CLI args:** hand-rolled flag parsing (only `--port`, `--no-open`, `--db`, `--version`, `--help`). Subcommand router deferred to M8.
- **Testing:** `bun test` (unit), Playwright (e2e against the web UI in M1+)
- **Lint/format:** Biome (faster, single tool) — or ESLint + Prettier if Biome lacks something we need
- **CI:** GitHub Actions — lint, typecheck, test, build matrix
- **Releases:** GitHub Releases + Bun cross-compile
- **Commits:** Conventional Commits

## 10a. Project structure (proposed)

Single package. `backend/` and `frontend/` at the root, no `packages/` wrapper. `shared/` at the root for the tiny bit of code (hashtag regex) genuinely used by both.

`frontend` imports `type AppRouter` from `backend/trpc/router.ts` — that's the only `frontend → backend` coupling, and it's type-only (erased at runtime). Path aliases `@backend/*`, `@frontend/*`, `@shared/*` in `tsconfig.json` + `vite.config.ts`.

| 2026-05-13 | No sync, single-device — schema kept sync-ready (ULID, soft deletes)      | Scope control; leaves door open                                            |
| 2026-05-13 | Markdown storage; rich-text editor (TipTap) in web UI                     | "Editor matters"; portable; no lock-in                                     |
| 2026-05-13 | No headings; allow bold/italic/lists/code/links/blockquote                | Flat journal, not document tool                                            |
| 2026-05-13 | No auth; local profile row for personalisation                            | Single device, but greet the user                                          |
| 2026-05-13 | OSS, releasable; tests + docs + CI from day one                           | Long-haul intent                                                           |
| 2026-05-13 | Aim: weekend prototype first, long-haul project after                     | De-risk architecture before investing in polish                            |
| 2026-05-13 | TypeScript-only stack (no Rust)                                           | User direction; keep stack uniform                                         |
| 2026-05-13 | Encryption deferred                                                       | User direction; OS disk encryption is enough for v1                        |
| 2026-05-13 | AI features via shell-out to `claude` CLI                                 | Zero dep on Anthropic SDK; reuses user's existing auth                     |
| 2026-05-13 | Runtime: Bun                                                              | TS-native, single-binary compile, `Bun.serve`, fast startup                |
| 2026-05-13 | Binary name: `jottapp`                                                    | Matches "Jott App" branding; no collision with macOS BSD `jot`             |
| 2026-05-13 | Claude detection: assume on PATH; disable AI features if missing          | Friction-free for users who have it, graceful for those who don't         |
| 2026-05-13 | Tags: auto-extracted from `#word` tokens in body; editor highlights them  | Zero-friction tagging; same regex in CLI + UI                              |
| 2026-05-13 | IDs hidden in UI; hidden in CLI by default (`--ids` to reveal 8-char)     | Cleaner ergonomics; IDs are an implementation detail                       |
| 2026-05-13 | UI styling: Tailwind                                                      | Fast, boring, well-trodden                                                 |
| 2026-05-13 | **Shape:** single binary that bundles a local web server + UI            | User direction; clean migration path to Electron later                     |
| 2026-05-13 | SQLite via `better-sqlite3` (not `bun:sqlite`)                            | Works in Bun AND Node — survives a future Electron migration unchanged    |
| 2026-05-13 | Electron is deferred (M7), not v1                                         | Web-server shape covers v1; Electron later if we want native install UX    |
| 2026-05-13 | No localhost auth — pure trust-the-loopback                               | Single-device personal app; auth would be UX cost with no real threat      |
| 2026-05-13 | Fixed port 4853; fail to start if taken (no fallback)                     | Predictable, bookmarkable; failure mode is clear ("already running?")      |
| 2026-05-13 | v1 = `jottapp serve` only; no CLI subcommands                             | Web UI is the only interface in v1; subcommand router deferred to M8       |
| 2026-05-13 | Backend: Hono on Bun                                                      | Lightweight, fetch-native, runs anywhere — survives Electron migration     |
| 2026-05-13 | API: tRPC at `/api/trpc` (fetch adapter), React Query on the client          | End-to-end typesafe; zero schema duplication between server and UI         |
| 2026-05-13 | Dev: Hono mounts Vite dev server as middleware                           | One origin, one port, HMR works — best DX                                  |
| 2026-05-13 | DB: `bun:sqlite` + Drizzle (overrides earlier `better-sqlite3` decision)  | User direction; Drizzle schema is portable, Electron migration = driver swap |
| 2026-05-13 | Migrations: `PRAGMA user_version` + one `.sql` file per version           | Native SQLite pattern; each migration runs exactly once; clean git history  |
| 2026-05-13 | Project layout: `backend/` + `frontend/` + `shared/` at repo root        | Clear split, no monorepo tooling overhead, type-only coupling via tRPC      |
| 2026-05-13 | Rename `Jot` → `Entry` as the primary data primitive                      | "Jot it down" is the verb/brand; "entry" is the noun. Cleaner semantics    |
| 2026-05-13 | Tags normalised into a `tags` table + `entry_tags` join                   | Reusable styling (colour, initials), supports both `#topic` and `@user`     |
| 2026-05-13 | Tag types: `topic` (#) and `user` (@)                                     | Two distinct sigil-based conventions, distinct visual treatment             |
| 2026-05-13 | No tables in editor for v1                                                | Entries are short; clashes with flat-journal shape                          |
| 2026-05-13 | No attachments in v1; images planned as a future feature                  | Confirmed future direction; defer concrete shape until v1 ships             |
| 2026-05-13 | Tag delete = cascade; frontend handles broken tags gracefully             | Body is source of truth; tokens self-heal on next edit                      |
| 2026-05-13 | Tag rename updates Tag row only; frontend swaps display via `nameWhenLinked` | Single rename propagates to all historical entries without rewriting bodies |
| 2026-05-13 | Added `entry_tags.nameWhenLinked` to support rename-on-display            | Enables matching body tokens to the right Tag row after rename              |
| 2026-05-13 | Initials default: first letter per word (cap 2); single-word → first 2 letters | Deterministic, editable later from Tags settings                       |
| 2026-05-13 | Topic + User unified into single Tag model with `type` discriminator      | No separate Person model needed; sigil distinguishes type at parse-time     |
| 2026-05-13 | Images = M6 (between Durability and Release prep); other milestones pushed | Confirmed future direction worth doing pre-1.0; non-image attachments deferred |
| 2026-05-13 | Markdown export: emit literal body text (do not resolve tag renames)      | Body is source of truth; rename is a display-time concern only             |
| 2026-05-13 | Dev shape: two processes + Vite proxy (not Hono-mounts-Vite-middleware)   | Vite SSR loader can't resolve `bun:sqlite`; @hono/vite-dev-server fails for the same reason. Proxy is the simplest pattern that preserves single user-facing URL + HMR |
| 2026-05-13 | Dev port split: frontend `:4853` (user-facing), backend `:4854`           | Frontend owns the prod URL in dev too; backend gets an adjacent port; prod binary unchanged on `:4853` |
| 2026-05-13 | React 19 (not React 18 from earlier plan)                                 | Current stable; tRPC v11 + React Query 5 fully support it; no reason to pin to 18 |
| 2026-05-13 | Tailwind v4 with `@tailwindcss/vite`; no `tailwind.config.ts`             | v4 moves config into CSS via `@theme {}`; no JS config file needed         |
| 2026-05-13 | Static assets embedded via `with { type: 'file' }` import attribute       | Bun's `bun build --compile` embeds these; the runtime path resolves via `$bunfs` automatically |
| 2026-05-13 | Asset manifest generated at build time + stub committed for dev imports   | `backend/staticAssets.generated.ts` is committed as an empty Map; build script regenerates it, then restores the stub in `finally` so git stays clean |
| 2026-05-15 | Real client-side router via wouter (already a dep)                        | Three pages now: `/start`, `/timeline`, `/settings`. Lighter than react-router; matches the `Link` UX we want |
| 2026-05-15 | `/` decides destination from profile presence; `/timeline` shows banner if no profile | Direct nav to `/timeline` shouldn't lose the "set your name" prompt; redirect-on-root keeps the cold-start UX clean |
| 2026-05-15 | Settings split: `profile` (singleton) for personalisation, `settings` (k/v) for app config | Theme + name are per-user identity; `claude.binary` etc. are app-wide config — different shapes deserve different tables |
| 2026-05-15 | `db.path` is read-only in the UI (set at startup via `--db`/`JOTTAPP_DB`) | Changing the path mid-session would orphan the open DB handle; the setting screen surfaces it but doesn't pretend it's editable |
| 2026-05-15 | Dark mode via class-based `dark:` variants, applied to `<html>` from React | Tailwind v4 `@custom-variant dark (&:where(.dark, .dark *))`; `useApplyTheme` listens to `prefers-color-scheme` for `system` |
| 2026-05-15 | Settings registry shape: object `{ key: defaultValue }`, not array of valid keys  | New keys auto-merge into `getAll`; `getAll` always returns a fully-populated map (no nullable values for known keys) |
| 2026-05-15 | Driver pattern under `ai.driver` (default `claude`); per-driver config under `ai.<driver>.*` | Replaces the older `claude.binary` / `claude.model` / `claude.maxEntries` keys; future drivers slot in without churning the AI procedures |
| 2026-05-15 | Stop storing a `claude.binary` path; always use `claude` from `PATH`               | Detection via `Bun.which('claude')` at boot is enough — keeps settings to user-meaningful knobs (config dir, model) |
| 2026-05-15 | Pass `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` env (not a CLI flag) to scope the claude session          | Lets users point at a different account/profile without hard-coupling to specific CLI flags that may change |
| 2026-05-15 | Hard-code entry cap to 100 (no `ai.maxEntries` setting yet)                        | Avoids token blow-up; surface as a setting once a user actually wants to tune it |
| 2026-05-15 | AI procedures throw `PRECONDITION_FAILED` when driver/binary unavailable           | Single high-level error — UI just renders the message; matches CLAUDE.md's "let errors bubble" |
| 2026-05-16 | Export format: single concatenated `.md` file with HTML-comment entry markers      | Avoids `---` frontmatter delimiter clashing with TipTap horizontal rules in bodies; one file is more portable than a zip and needs no new dep |
| 2026-05-16 | Import is insert-only (skip on ID collision; no merge)                             | Predictable semantics; merge would require resolving createdAt/updatedAt/body conflicts with no good default. User can re-export from another DB if they need history |
| 2026-05-16 | Export excludes soft-deleted entries                                               | Export represents "the journal"; the live DB file (or `backup.onQuit` snapshot) is the right tool for full state including trash |
| 2026-05-16 | Backup via SQLite `VACUUM INTO` (not file copy)                                    | Produces a consistent, optimized snapshot even with WAL pending writes — no need to checkpoint or close the DB |
| 2026-05-16 | Raw `Database` handle threaded through tRPC context                                | Needed for `VACUUM INTO`; explicit dep beats reaching into Drizzle's `$client` private surface |
| 2026-05-16 | Backup-on-quit failures are logged, not fatal                                      | Shutdown should always close the DB cleanly; a failed snapshot shouldn't leave the process hanging |
| 2026-05-16 | Attachments stored on disk as `<dbPath dirname>/attachments/<id>.<ext>`; DB row carries metadata only | Keeps SQLite small and backups fast; id-addressable filenames avoid collisions and let `GET` set `immutable` caching |
| 2026-05-16 | Upload via `POST /api/attachments` (multipart), not tRPC                            | Binary payloads belong on a dedicated route; tRPC stays for typed JSON. 10 MB cap + image-MIME allowlist enforced server-side |
| 2026-05-16 | `attachments.entry_id` is nullable; reconciliation binds rows on entry save        | Lets the editor upload first (paste/drop/slash command) without forcing a draft entry, and lets the body remain the source of truth |
| 2026-05-16 | Markdown export embeds images as `data:` URIs (no sidecar files, no zip)            | Preserves the M5 "one .md file is the export" contract; trade file size for portability |
| 2026-05-16 | Import decodes `data:` URIs into fresh attachment rows + files                      | Round-trip works on a clean db; new IDs avoid clashing with any existing attachments |
| 2026-05-16 | Slash menu is a hand-rolled ProseMirror plugin (no `@tiptap/suggestion`)            | One item (`/image`) doesn't justify a dep; the menu is ~60 LOC and easy to extend later |
| 2026-05-16 | `imageUpload` placeholder node is a React NodeView; not persisted to markdown        | Lets the dropzone live inline in the editor with state (idle/uploading/error); never written out, so it can't leak into bodies |
| 2026-05-16 | Orphan attachments older than 24h GC'd at startup                                   | Bounded cleanup for uploads that were never claimed by an entry (e.g. composer dismissed) |
| 2026-05-16 | Timeline pagination uses `(ts, id)` cursor with id as a deterministic tiebreaker    | ULIDs are time-sortable but two entries can share a `createdAt` ms; pairing with `id DESC` keeps page boundaries stable and avoids dropped/duplicated rows when paging |
| 2026-05-16 | Fetch `limit + 1` to detect `hasMore` instead of a separate `COUNT(*)`              | One round-trip; the extra row is trimmed server-side. `COUNT` would scan the filtered set twice for no gain |
| 2026-05-16 | Search stays unpaginated; pagination is timeline-only                               | Search results are already capped at 50 by FTS bm25 ranking; users skim, not scroll. Adding cursor here would complicate the bm25 ordering for no real UX win |
